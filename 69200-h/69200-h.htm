<div class="verse indent0">A happy little Xmas tree.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“<span class="smcap large">Little</span> rabbit,” said Professor Jim Crow
as he opened his little Wisdom Book, “let
me read you something, for this is the season
of good cheer and happy hearts and Xmas
stockings and cranberry tarts.” And then
that wise old bird turned to page 23 and
began:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“When you hang up your stocking</div>

<div class="verse indent0">And looks with longing eyes upon</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The window’s Xmas treat.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Do you suppose he’d like some of my
last year’s toys?” asked Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Of course he would,” answered Professor
Jim Crow, and he smiled to himself as
he shut his book, for he knew he had sowed
a good seed for a kindly deed in the little
rabbit’s heart. And then that old black bird
flew away, and Little Jack Rabbit hopped
home to the Old Bramble Patch and up to
his little room. And after he had looked
over all his toys he packed some in a box
and took them downstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Mother, I’m going to the village to see
the little ragged bunny boy.”</p>

<p>“What for?” asked Lady Love. And if
you haven’t guessed what, I’ll tell you. He
was going to give that little ragged rabbit
boy the toys so that he would have a merry
Xmas, too.</p>

<p>“Look out for Mr. Wicked Wolf,” said
Lady Love, and then she gave the little
bunny a lollypop and kissed him good-by,
and after that away he hopped, and by and
by, after a while, he came to a shabby little
house near Rabbitville. So he knocked on
the door and pretty soon it opened and there
stood the little ragged rabbit’s mother.</p>

<p>“Here are some Xmas presents,” said the
little bunny. “They are my last year’s best
toys, but I want your little ragged rabbit to
have a happy Xmas.” And then he hopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
away as fast as he could, for he was afraid
the rabbit lady was going to cry. And
maybe she did, for sometimes people cry
when they are happy, although I never
heard of their laughing when they were sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">This</span> is the song the little canary bird sang
in her gold cage while Little Jack Rabbit
polished the front door knob and Lady
Love made the stuffing for the big turkey.
And just then the telephone bell rang and
Uncle John Hare, the old gentleman rabbit,
said, “Hello! I want to speak to Little
Jack Rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said the little Black
Cricket who had answered the telephone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
because Lady Love was busy and Little
Jack Rabbit couldn’t leave the door knob
all covered with wet polish, and she ran out
to the front porch and said:</p>

<p>“Uncle John wants to speak to you on the
’phone.” Well, by this time, the door knob
was polished nice and dry, so the little rabbit
hopped inside.</p>

<p>“Hello, it’s me,” said the little bunny,
although my teacher always told me to say,
“It’s I,” but never mind, Uncle John knew
what the little rabbit meant, just the same.</p>

<p>“What do you want for Xmas?” asked
the dear, kind, old gentleman rabbit. “Tell
me a thousand things, and then you can’t
guess what I’m going to get.”</p>

<p>So the little rabbit thought and thought,
and by and by, after a while, and maybe a
little longer, he thought of 999. But, oh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
dear me, he couldn’t think of just one more.
Wasn’t that too bad?</p>

<p>“Well, never mind,” laughed Uncle John.
“That’s enough. And now I’ll go down to
the Three-in-one-cent Store, and to-morrow
you’ll see what I bought.” And then he
hung up the receiver and went out to the
garage, hitched up the Bunnymobile, and
pretty soon, not so very long, he reached the
Three-in-one-cent Store in Rabbitville, on
the corner of Lettuce Avenue and Popcorn
Street.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better go over to the bank
and get some money first,” thought the old
gentleman rabbit. So he hopped across the
street and wrote a check and then the paying
teller gave him a lot of money for it—lettuce
dollar bills and carrot cents and a
ten-carrot gold piece, and after that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
hopped back to the Three-in-one-cent Store
and went inside. And what do you suppose
was the first thing he saw? Why, a lovely
book all about Little Jack Rabbit. “I’ll
take that book,” said the old gentleman
bunny as quick as a twinkle. And then he
bought a pair of roller skates and a pair of
ice skates and a red sled and a bag of candy
and a box of lead soldiers and a big red
apple and a magic lantern. And a lot more
things besides, but, goodness me, I haven’t
got room enough in this story to put them
in, so we’ll have to wait and call up on
Christmas morning and ask him. And if
you don’t know his telephone it’s “O, O, O,
Ring Happy Bell, Old Brier Patch!”</p>

“Merrie Xmas, Mother.” And then, of
course, Lady Love woke up, and the alarm
clock couldn’t make up its mind whether
it would say anything or not. But after a
little while it began to sing:</p>

<div class="verse indent0">A stocking full as full can be,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>And then the little Black Cricket came
out of her crack in the warm hearth and
looked in her stocking, for she believed in
Santa Claus just the same as she always did
when she was a little young cricket and
played hop, skip and jump in the Sunny
Meadow grass.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Hurrah! I’ve got everything
I asked for!” shouted Little Jack
Rabbit. So you see, dear, kind Uncle John
Hare must have spent all his money at the
Three-in-one-cent Store!</p>

<p>Well, by and by, after a while, they
heard sleigh bells outside in the Old Bramble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Patch, and pretty soon Uncle John Hare
jumped out of his Bunnymobile and came
into the house to give Lady Love a lovely
gold vanity bag and a pair of lorgnettes, a
kind of lollypop eyeglass, you know.</p>

<p>And, oh, yes, oh, yes! I forgot to say he
gave the little Black Cricket a new fur piece
and the Canary Bird a bushel of bird seed.
And after that every one was happy as could
be. And just as they were all sitting down
to their Xmas dinner a knock came at the
kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Come in if you’re not Mr. Wicked
Wolf,” said Uncle John Hare, and who do
you suppose walked in? Why, the Yellow
Dog Tramp, with a large package in his
front paws.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, the Xmas tree didn’t run back to the
friendly forest as I feared it might in the
last story. It stayed right in the little house
in the Old Bramble Patch, and the night
after Xmas when the little Black Cricket
came out on the hearth, that dear little
Xmas tree began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Oh, I have had my heart’s delight,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I’ve been a Xmas tree,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">I do not miss the shady wood,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">For I have found my heart’s delight</div>
<div class="verse indent0">A little child to please.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Well, in the morning Little Jack Rabbit
took his skates and went down to the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
mill pond, and so did Uncle John Hare, for
he could skate mighty well, let me tell you,
even if he did have gray whiskers and a
pink waistcoat. Why, he could do the
grapevine twist and the letter S and maybe
the whole alphabet, for all I know.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, off they went, Little Jack
Rabbit and his kind Uncle John Hare, and
when they came to the pond they put on
their skates, and then off they went over the
ice as fast as the wind, and maybe faster,
and by and by, after a while, who should
come by but Mr. Grouse. He had on his
snowshoes which kind Mother Nature had
given him.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” said Uncle John Hare. “You
can’t go over the snow as fast as I can on
the ice, my man.” You see, Uncle John
Hare knew how to make up poetry and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
once written some in a beautiful birthday
album.</p>

<p>“No, but I can slide over the snow just
as well as if I were on a toboggan.” And
maybe he would have shown Uncle John
Hare just what he could do, if all of a sudden,
something hadn’t happened. And isn’t
it too bad that something always has to
happen just when these two dear little rabbits
are having a nice time?</p>

<p>And now I suppose you are wondering
what did happen, so I’ll tell you right away.
Mr. Wicked Wolf jumped out from behind
a snow drift, and said: “Ha, ha. What
shall I eat first—rabbit or grouse?” Wasn’t
that a dreadful thing to hear? Well, I just
guess it was. And then what do you think
Uncle John Hare did. Why, he just picked
up a piece of ice and hit that wicked old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
wolf right on the end of his nose. And
then, of course, Mr. Wicked Wolf had to
wipe his eyes, for they were full of tears,
and while he was doing that the two little
rabbits skated away, and Mr. Grouse snowshoed
away, and if the skates don’t come off
and the snowshoes, too, I’ll tell you some
more in a day or two.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5">THE THINKING CAP</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Oh</span>, dear me. I just hate to start this story,
for I must tell you something very unpleasant.
You remember in the last one Little
Jack Rabbit and Uncle John Hare were
skating away as fast as they could from Mr.
Wicked Wolf. But, oh, dear me. All of a
sudden, just like that, Uncle John Hare’s
skate came off. And of course that wasn’t
lucky, let me tell you. Oh, my, no. It was
simply dreadful. And when Mr. Wicked
Wolf saw the predicament, which means a
dreadful fix, you know, which the dear old
gentleman rabbit was in, he kicked up his
heels and pretty soon he was so close that
even if Uncle John Hare could have fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
on his skate again he never would
have been able to get away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Ha ha, ho ho, now I’ve got you two,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And I’ll skate you both till you’re black and blue,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And then I’ll take you home for a stew.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">For Mrs. Wolf knows how to make</div>
<div class="verse indent0">A rabbit stew and a big pancake.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, oh, dear me again, and maybe once
more, for I don’t know what’s going to happen,
and maybe it will happen before I can
write it, and then what will we all do, I
should like to know? Maybe there won’t
be any more stories.</p>

<p>“Wait just a minute, Mr. Wicked Wolf,”
said the old gentleman rabbit, and he took
out his gold watch and chain. “It’s just
13 o’clock, and that’s a very unlucky number.”
Mr. Wicked Wolf scratched his
head, for he didn’t know what to do, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
neither would I and neither would you if
we had been there.</p>

<p>“I’ll wait till five minutes past 13,” said
the wicked old wolf with a grin, which
showed all his white teeth, and the gold one
which Dr. Dentist Duck had put in after
the railroad accident, which I’ll tell you
about some day if I don’t forget it.</p>

<p>“Now put on your thinking cap,” said
Uncle John Hare. So Little Jack Rabbit
opened his knapsack and took out a little
pink worsted thinking cap and put it on
his head and pretty soon, not so very long,
before the five minutes were up, of course,
he said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Mr. Wolf, if I were you</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I wouldn’t eat a rabbit stew;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I’d rather have a chicken pie</div>
<div class="verse indent2">If I were you and you were I.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“I never thought of chicken pie,” answered
Mr. Wicked Wolf, and the more he
thought about it the more he wanted it. So
pretty soon he said:</p>

<p>“I’ll let you off this time if you’ll motor
me to the Farmyard.” But, oh, dear me!
Those two little rabbits didn’t want to do
that. No, sireemam.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and decide,” growled Mr.
Wicked Wolf with a dreadful grin.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Wait a minute if you please,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I’m so worried I shall sneeze,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>said Uncle John Hare. I guess he would
have said ’most anything to gain time.</p>

<p>Just then, all of a sudden, who should
come along but the Yellow Dog Tramp.
Wasn’t that lucky? So the little rabbits
started off in their Bunnymobile without
Mr. Wicked Wolf.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c6">BRAVE YELLOW DOG TRAMP</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span> if the brave Yellow Dog Tramp had
been a minute later perhaps and maybe the
two little rabbits would have been eaten up
in the last story. For just as he came along
Mr. Wicked Wolf grew impatient and with
a dreadful growl jumped out from behind
the Bunnymobile.</p>

<p>And, oh, dear me. Didn’t his eyes look
fierce, and didn’t his mouth look red and his
teeth white?</p>

<p>And if you can think of anything worse
at night than a wolf’s face, please tell me,
for I’d like to know if there is anything that
really can scare that brave Yellow Dog
Tramp.</p>

<p>“Stop, or I’ll bite one of your rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
tires,” screamed Mr. Wicked Wolf, and he
took hold with his teeth. And then what
do you think that brave Yellow Dog Tramp
did?</p>

<p>Why, he leaned out of the automobile
and hit that wolf on the head with a monkey
wrench, and that wolf saw three million
five hundred and ninety-nine and a half
stars, and then he rolled over on the snow
and began to cry, and then the tire which he
had bitten burst and all the air came out—Oh,
dear me, now I’m saying something
which isn’t true, for the Bunnymobile had
runners in the winter and not wheels.</p>

<p>So how could air come out of a steel
runner? No, sir, that wasn’t what happened
at all. It was this way.</p>

<p>The old gentleman rabbit got out the air
pump and blew snow all over that wolf till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
he was covered with a drift as high as the
Old Rail Fence and it took him all night
to dig himself out.</p>

<p>Well, after that Uncle John Hare started
off for home, but just before he reached the
corner of Lettuce Avenue and Carrot Street,
he came across the Policeman Dog, who,
when he saw the Yellow Dog Tramp,
shouted:</p>

<p>“Stop the car,” and this made Uncle John
Hare angry, for he knew that Policeman
Dog wanted to arrest the Yellow Dog
Tramp. So Uncle John Hare made the
Bunnymobile go so fast that the Policeman
Dog’s whistle fell out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you,” said the Yellow
Dog Tramp, and he began to bark, and
just then a little deer came by.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if Santa Claus is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
around? I have a brother who helps pull
his sleigh and I want to see him.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re too late, my little deer,”
said Uncle John Hare, “Xmas is over and
Santa Claus won’t come again for another
year.” And then the little deer began to
cry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Oh, dear, it is so long to wait</div>
<div class="verse indent0">’Till Xmas comes around,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">What shall I do until the time</div>
<div class="verse indent0">When Xmas bells will sound.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Jump into my Bunnymobile,” said kind
Uncle John Hare. “You come home with
us. I have a little barn right next to my
garage where it’s nice and warm. You
shall have some hay to eat.”</p>

<p>So the little deer jumped into the Bunnymobile
and the kind old gentleman rabbit
took him home, and on the next page you
shall hear what happened after that.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7">SANTA’S REINDEER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the story before this I promised to tell
you what happened to the little reindeer.</p>

<p>Well, after kind Uncle John Hare had
put the Bunnymobile in the garage, he led
the little reindeer into the barn and gave
him some nice hay to eat, and then he closed
the door so that Mr. North Wind couldn’t
get in, and after that the kind old gentleman
bunny went into the house, with Little
Jack Rabbit and the Yellow Dog Tramp
who was with him, you remember, in the
last story.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the old gentleman rabbit
made the graphophone play a tune, and this
is what it was:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Meet me at the fountain when the syrups are in bloom,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And the lollypops are blushing like roses red in June,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And the fizzy soda water comes sparkling in the glass,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And the ice cream cones are dancing like fairies in the grass.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, dear me! I wish the good old summer
time were here once more, I do, for
that’s the time a Yellow Dog has something
nice to do,” and the Yellow Dog Tramp
sighed a great big sigh and lay down in
front of the open fire and fell asleep. So
Uncle John Hare blew out the electric
lights and pulled down the shades and went
to bed, and then he had a dream.</p>

<p>And then he had a nightmare, and then
he woke himself up with a dreadful yell,
for he thought a crocodile was just going to
swallow his old wedding stovepipe hat. I
suppose the crocodile thought it was a big
chocolate drop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>Well, after that, the old gentleman rabbit
looked at his gold watch and chain, and as
it was nearly fourteen o’clock, and Mr.
Merry Sun was just getting up, Uncle John
Hare dressed himself and went downstairs
to tell his Japanese servant to have breakfast
as soon as possible, and then he went
out to the barn to see how the little reindeer
was getting along. And, oh, dear me!
Wasn’t he surprised to find three more reindeer
in the barn.</p>

<p>“Why, where did you come from?” asked
the old gentleman rabbit, and he scratched
his left ear with his right hind foot, for he
couldn’t think how they ever got into the
barn.</p>

<p>“We are Santa Claus’s deer,” they answered,
“and if you’ll hitch us up to your
old sleigh we’ll be glad to give you a ride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>So the old gentleman rabbit hitched them
up to his old-fashioned sleigh, and then he
put on his fur overcoat and gloves and told
Little Jack Rabbit and the Yellow Dog
Tramp to get in, too, and away they went to
the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>And how those beautiful reindeer did go!
They tossed their long horns and threw out
their heels and the bells on the sleigh made
beautiful music. Well, by and by, pretty
soon, not so very long, they drove up in
front of the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p>The next minute Lady Love, the little
rabbit’s mother, hopped out of the house.
And wasn’t she surprised? She hadn’t
seen Santa Claus’s reindeer for a long time,
and neither have I, not since I was a little
boy and stayed awake all Xmas eve
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, sir! by this time if ever a little bunny
was crazy to go sleigh riding it was Little
Jack Rabbit as he looked at the four reindeer
hitched up to the old sleigh. And
wouldn’t you love to go sleigh riding behind
four of Santa Claus’s reindeer?</p>

<p>Well, I just guess you would, and so
would I and so would the Czar of Russia
if he hadn’t lost his throne.</p>

<p>“Now hurry up and get on your fur overcoat,”
said the old gentleman rabbit, while
the reindeer pawed the snow and tossed
their antlers, which are their horns, you
know—until the bells on the harness began
chiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>And pretty soon out came Little Jack
Rabbit with his fur overcoat, and jumping
into the sleigh sat down beside dear, kind
Uncle John Hare.</p>

<p>“On, Dixon and Blixon! On, Bullet and
Arrow!” cried the old gentleman rabbit,
and away went the reindeer, while Lady
Love waved her calico apron from the
window and smiled to see how happy was
her little bunny boy.</p>

<p>Well, after a while, or maybe a mile,
Little Jack Rabbit said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Let’s go down to the photographer and
have our picture taken.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Uncle John Hare, and
the Yellow Dog Tramp said he’d never had
his picture taken in his life and would be
tickled to death to have one to send home to
his old mother who lived in New Hampshire
and hadn’t heard from him since he’d
left home.</p>

<p>Well, when they came to the picture place
the photographer, who was a long-legged
crane—as I told you once upon a time some
fifty stories ago, or maybe more—came out
of his little picture gallery.</p>

<p>And, oh, my! he shivered so that he almost
spoilt the picture, for he had to bring his
camera outside because the four reindeer
and the sleigh and the two little rabbits and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
the Yellow Dog Tramp couldn’t get into his
little shop.</p>

<p>You see, the crane didn’t have any stockings
on and his great long legs got dreadfully
cold.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent0">“Now, look pleasant, if you please,</div>

</div>

<p>and Photographer Crane almost sneezed
his head off, as he stood on one leg and
pulled the other one out of the snow way
up under his feathers. Then he sneezed
again.</p>

<p>But, by and by, the pictures were taken,
and Uncle John Hare paid for them all,
and the Yellow Dog Tramp took his over to
the Postoffice and sent it to his mother, way
up in New Hampshire, and on the back he
wrote:</p>

perhaps I’d never get things right if I hadn’t
made a book out of these stories, so that I
can look back and see whether it was Uncle
John Hare or the Big Brown Bear, or the

</div>

<p>Well, here we are. The Yellow Dog
Tramp had just posted his photograph to
his dear old mother way up in New Hampshire,
and after he had thanked the postoffice
lady, who was an old maid duck, he
jumped into the sleigh and said:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then you should have seen how those
Reindeer went. Well, sir, they went so
fast that pretty soon their feet hardly
touched the earth, and then they didn’t
touch at all, and then, oh, me, oh, my!
They rose right up in the air just like a low
sailing rocket, over the treetops and over
the steeples, over the houses and over the
peoples. Goodness me!</p>

<p>There goes my typewriter again making
up poetry and not putting it into verses, and
if it does it again I’m going to change the
ribbon and get one that is red, white and
blue. My typewriter must show its color
as well as a man!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Well, pretty soon, the old gentleman rabbit
began to get uneasy, for he wasn’t used
to sailing through the sky in a sleigh drawn
by reindeer. “What do you think’s going
to happen!” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry, Uncle John,” answered
the little rabbit. “I’ve often seen pictures
of Santa Claus riding through the air in his
sleigh.”</p>

<p>And this quite comforted the old gentleman
bunny, you know, and he began to
smile and the Yellow Dog Tramp barked
two times and a half, and after that they
came to a snowy road right in the sky.</p>

<p>And the hoofs of the Reindeer made a
lovely tinkling noise as they beat on the
silvery frozen path. But of course the little
rabbits didn’t know they were sliding over
the Milky Way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>No, indeed. And they didn’t know it was
all frozen over, either, and neither would
I have known this if a little snowbird hadn’t
told me.</p>

<p>Well, after a while, they came to a place
where the Great Bear and the Little Bear
lived. It was way up in the Star Country,
you see, and of course it was all very
strange.</p>

<p>But the Reindeer seemed to know the
way, and so Uncle John Hare just let them
go. And then the Great Bear, who sat on
a piece of ice that had five sharp points just
like a star, said:</p>

<p>“Mr. John Hare, I’m glad to see you.”
And then the Little Bear, who also sat on
a five-pointed piece of ice, said: “I’m glad
to see you, Little Jack Rabbit!”</p>

<p>And then the Reindeer stopped, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
had been going around and around the two
bears all the time, you know, and the two
little rabbits hopped out of the sleigh, and
into the next story.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, as soon as the two little rabbits had
hopped out of the sleigh, the Great Bear
stretched out his paw and shook hands with
Uncle John Hare and the Little Bear shook
paws with Little Jack Rabbit, and while all
this was going on, the Reindeer suddenly
started off.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious meebus!” exclaimed
the old gentleman rabbit, “there goes my
team of Reindeer! How are we ever going
to get home?”</p>

<p>Now wasn’t that a dreadful fix to be in?
Well, I should say it was. Way up in a
Sky Country, in Star Land, making a call
on the Great Bear and the Little Bear!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
And no way to get home unless you slid
down a moonbeam, and that’s a very dangerous
thing to do unless you’re a fairy and
know all about it. But don’t get worried,
for I’m going to tell you something.</p>

<p>As soon as the Yellow Dog Tramp, who
hadn’t jumped out of the sleigh, you
remember, saw what was happening, he
grabbed up the reins and turned those Reindeer
around as quick as a wink, and pretty
soon he drove them back to the five-pointed
pieces of ice where the two little rabbits
and the Great Bear and the Little Bear
were sitting.</p>

<p>“Come on!” said the Yellow Dog Tramp.
“Let’s get home before the Dog Star catches
us!” And away went the Reindeer down
the silver Milky Way and pretty soon they
were all safely riding over the snow through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
the Shady Forest toward Uncle John Hare’s
house.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll have to go back to the North
Pole,” said the Reindeer after they had
drawn the sleigh into the barn.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to hear that,” said the old gentleman
rabbit; “I like sleigh riding. But
of course, if you must go, you know best,”
and then the reindeer said good-by and
went away to the cold north country where
Santa Claus lives and the Xmas trees grow.</p>

<p>And then the Yellow Dog Tramp said he
was going back to New Hampshire to see
his dear old mother.</p>

<p>“Take this ten-carrot gold piece to her,”
said dear, kind, generous Uncle John Hare,
and that Tramp Dog almost cried with joy
and away he went back to the old homestead
in the Green Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>Well, by this time it was pretty late and
Mr. Merry Sun had disappeared over the
Western Hills, so the two little rabbits went
into the house and Uncle John Hare hung
up his great fur overcoat and put on his
slippers and sat down before the fire to
warm his paws, and while he sat there a
little cricket came out of a crack in the floor
and began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“I’m the cricket on the hearth,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Listen while I sing,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Though it’s cold and bleak outdoors,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And Jack Frost will nip your paws</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Round the hearth it’s warm and bright</div>
<div class="verse indent0">In the fire’s golden light.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when that little cricket looked up
she saw Uncle John Hare fast asleep and
Little Jack Rabbit, too, for they were tired
out with their long, long sleigh ride.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c11">RESOLUTIONS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, let me see. We left Little Jack Rabbit
in Uncle John Hare’s house in the last
story, didn’t we? And Uncle John had
just brought out a nice apple pie, and the
three little grasshoppers and the tiny black
cricket had helped the dear old gentleman
rabbit eat it up. Well, after a while, Little
Jack Rabbit said he must be going, for he
wanted to get back to the Old Bramble
Patch before New Year’s Eve. So he said
good-by and hopped away, and by and by,
not so very far, he saw Professor Jim Crow
with his little Wisdom Book.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, little rabbit. Have you
thought about the New Year?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” answered Little Jack Rabbit.
“I’ve thought a lot about it.”</p>

<p>“Let me read you something,” said the
wise old professor and then he opened his
little Wisdom Book, but first, of course, he
put on his spectacles.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“You must make a res-o-lu-tion—</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Which means a promise to yourself—</div>
<div class="verse indent0">That you will be a rabbit</div>

<div class="verse indent0">And do to other people what you would do for self.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then Professor Jim Crow closed his
book with a bang and flew away to read a
lesson on good manners to a naughty little
cat who wore her mother’s hat.</p>

<p>Well, after that, the little rabbit hopped
along and by and by he came in sight of the
Old Rail Fence, and through the rails he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
could see the Old Bramble Patch and his
mother hanging out the wash, for it was
Monday, and Lady Love washed on Monday,
and ironed on Tuesday, and sometimes
on Wednesday if Little Jack Rabbit wore
more than one shirtwaist a day.</p>

<p>And just then he thought of what the old
crow had just read to him: “Let me hand
you the clothespins, mother dear, so you
won’t have to stoop down and wrinkle your
ear.” And this made the kind lady rabbit
laugh, for she didn’t know that her little
bunny son could make up poetry, just like
that, all of a sudden, you know.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon there was only one
clothespin left and two stockings, so he ran
into the woodshed and got another clothespin
for his mother, and after that they both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
went into the kitchen, for it was almost
lunch time.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse indent0">“It’s half-past one, and the cake is done,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">Or I’m afraid the sliced carrot will burn.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, goodness gracious me! When Lady
Love heard that she looked all around to
see who was telling her what to do. But
she didn’t see anybody, and neither did the
little rabbit until he looked up at the new
clock which Uncle John Hare had given
his mother for Xmas and then the little
bunny knew who was talking, for just inside
the Cuckoo Clock House door stood the
little bird who told the time of day.</p>

<p>Pretty soon it began to storm, and Mr.
North Wind blew great clouds of snow
around the little house in the Old Bramble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Patch. And sometimes he whistled down
the chimney till the little cricket in the
woodbox shivered and wished it were Summer

<div class="verse indent0">The old farm pump is frozen tight,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">When Mr. North Wind fierce and chill,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Came blowing down the big high hill.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Goodness</span> me! When the kind-hearted
farmer got up in the morning after Cocky
Doodles had sung his cock-a-doodle-do
song and went out to pump some water, he
couldn’t get any. No, siree. There was a
big icicle hanging from the pump spout,
and the water wouldn’t come out. So he
cracked off the icicle and went back into
the kitchen for a pail of hot water to pour
down the old pump, and after that the water
came out of the spout and Mrs. Cow got a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
drink of water, although she had to wait
until the clock struck half-past eight.</p>

<p>And, oh, dear me! It was just as cold
over at the Old Bramble Patch and Lady
Love had a dreadful time getting breakfast,
for Mr. North Wind kept blowing
down the chimney and sending the ashes all
over the floor, and this made Lady Love
dreadfully nervous, for she always liked to
have her kitchen spick and span and cook
her food on the Hoover plan.</p>

<p>Well, after breakfast was over, Little
Jack Rabbit hopped out doors, for he wasn’t
afraid of the cold. Oh, my, no. His little
white fur overcoat kept him as warm as
toast. And just as he was going to hop
along the little path he saw Charlie Chickadee
and Jimmy Junko flying here and there
in the Old Bramble Patch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t mind if we eat up the old
dried berries, do you?” asked the little
Chickadee, “for there isn’t much to find
when the ground is covered with snow.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Eat all you wish,” answered the little
rabbit, and then these two little winter birds
stuffed their pockets full of dried berries to
take home, and when they could find no
more they flew out on the Sunny Meadow
where the fluffy grass stalks stood out above
the snow, and picked off the little grass
seeds, and after that they flew away. So
the little rabbit hopped along and by and
by, after a while, he came to the old chestnut
tree where Chippy Chipmunk lived in
the summer time in a hole under the spreading
roots. But Chippy was nowhere to be
seen. Oh, my, no. All during the fall he
had been busy storing away nuts and grain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in his little storeroom where he would be
warm and safe from Mr. North Wind, and
have something to eat till Miss Spring came
with the whispering breezes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c13">THE BUNNYSNOWBILE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, just as Little Jack Rabbit hopped
into this story, Uncle John Hare, who was
all alone in his little white house, gave a
lonely sigh, and, as soon as he had finished
breakfast, he hopped out over the snow to
his garage to get his Bunnysnowbile.
Dear me! I forgot to mention that he had
fastened on runners in place of the four
wheels and now had a wonderful autosleighbile
or something just as good as a
bobsled going down hills.</p>

<p>It didn’t take him long to find Little Jack
Rabbit and very soon they were gliding
along as nicely as you please. The Bunnysnowbile
behaved very well. You see, it
was such a short time after Xmas that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
hadn’t grown tired of looking at the Xmas
presents, like a good many little girls and
boys I know, and so it slid along over the
snow and didn’t try to climb up any telegraph
poles, and this made Uncle John
Hare feel very pleasant, so he began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The glad New Year has come and so</div>
<div class="verse indent0">We’ll try until next year</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To be as good as we can be</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And help our friends to cheer.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, oh, dear me! Just then, all of a sudden,
just like that, out popped Mr. Wicked
Wolf I’ve so often told you about. And
oh, dear me! again. Didn’t he look fierce?
His collar was turned up and his mouth
was wide open, and his long, white teeth
looked so cruel that Uncle John Hare shut
his eyes, and then, I hate to tell it, the
Bunnysnowbile ran right into a big tree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and turned over three times and a half, and
it might have turned-over once more if it
hadn’t landed right up against an old hollow
stump.</p>

<p>Which you’ll soon see was mighty lucky
for the two little rabbits. For when Mr.
Wicked Wolf saw them sprawling over the
snow he jumped as quick as a wink and
maybe he would have caught dear, kind
Uncle John Hare if that old gentleman rabbit
hadn’t hopped inside that stump.</p>

<p>And before he was inside Little Jack
Rabbit was, too, so that all Mr. Wicked
Wolf could do was to sit outside and wait
for them to come out. But they didn’t.
No, sireemam, and no, sireemister. They
knew better than that, and so would I if I
didn’t have a gun and a pistol and maybe
a big long knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I can sit here as long as you can,”
said that dreadful wolf, and he licked his
lips with his long red tongue and grinned,
oh, a dreadful kind of a grin.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” replied Uncle John
Hare. “If you want to sit in the cold snow,
do so,” and then the old gentleman rabbit
took off his old wedding stovepipe hat and
blocked up the hole in the hollow stump so
that the wolf couldn’t see what was going
on inside, you know. And then the old
gentleman rabbit looked around to see if
there was any way to get out.</p>

<p>Well, by and by, after a while, Little
Jack Rabbit found a small hole in the back
of the stump, and taking his pickaxe out of
his knapsack, set to work to dig a hole big
enough to squeeze through, into the next
story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c14">THE OLD WEDDING STOVEPIPE<br />
HAT</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">You</span> remember where we left off in the last
story, I hope. But in case you don’t, I’ll
tell you. Little Jack Rabbit and dear,
kind Uncle John Hare were hiding in a
hollow stump and Mr. Wicked Wolf was
sitting outside waiting to eat them up. But
he won’t if I can help it. No, sireebus!
Not if I have to call up the Policeman Dog
to help these two little rabbits.</p>

<p>Well, after a while, Little Jack Rabbit
made a hole in the back of the stump
through which he and the old gentleman
rabbit could just squeeze.</p>

<p>But before they did, the little rabbit put
his pickaxe back in his knapsack, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
he might have to use it some time again,
and one doesn’t find pickaxes lying around
loose, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Not in these days when iron costs almost
as much as sugar and sugar costs more than
diamonds, and diamonds—well, I don’t
know what they cost, for I never wear any.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! I hate to leave my old wedding
stovepipe hat in that hole,” said dear,
kind Uncle John Hare, which you remember
he had stuffed up with his old silk hat
to keep Mr. Wicked Wolf from looking in.</p>

<p>“We’ll make a snowball and put it there
instead,” said Little Jack Rabbit, and when
that was done, they both hopped quietly out
of the back door. But, oh, dear me. After
they were once out, they were afraid to go
any further, for Mr. Wicked Wolf would
surely see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>So they hopped inside and closed up the
back hole with the old wedding stovepipe
hat, and then they didn’t know what to do.
And neither do I, so I hope somebody will
help those two poor little rabbits.</p>

<p>Well, after a while, along came Danny
Fox. So Mr. Wicked Wolf said to him:
“You go around to the back of the stump
and see if you can find out anything, and
I’ll stay here.”</p>

<p>Then Danny Fox crept around and as
soon as he saw Uncle John Hare’s old wedding
stovepipe hat in the hole he knew who
was inside. You bet he did, even if he
hadn’t smelt rabbit or seen little rabbit footprints
in the snow.</p>

<p>And then, pretty soon, Mr. Wicked Wolf
pushed in the snowball and then he pushed
his head inside. But when he tried to pull<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
it out, his head, you know, not the snowball,
he couldn’t. No, sireemam.</p>

<p>His head was stuck fast. But it isn’t very
pleasant to have a big wolf’s head inside a
hollow stump when there’s hardly room
enough for you, let me say, and of course
the two little rabbits were almost scared to
death.</p>

<p>And when Danny Fox saw what was the
matter, he laughed so hard that he rolled
over and over on the snow and the first
thing he knew he rolled right down the hill.</p>

<p>Quick as a minute Uncle John Hare put
on his hat and he and Little Jack Rabbit
hopped away as fast as they could, and even
faster, and pretty soon they came to the Old
Bramble Patch, where Lady Love, the
little bunny’s mother, stood waiting for
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c15">THE POLICEMAN DOG</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, I hated to end my last story without
telling you what happened to the Bunnysnowbile
which the little rabbits left upside
down beside the old hollow stump where
Mr. Wicked Wolf was caught fast, you remember.</p>

<p>But you see I didn’t have room, and
where one doesn’t have room one must leave
a lot of things to the im-ag-in-ation, which
means “make-believe,” you know.</p>

<p>Well, at about 14 o’clock that very night
Uncle John Hare heard the big bell on the
Bunnysnowbile ringing like everything.
So he pushed up the window and stuck out
his head, and asked:</p>

<p>“Is that my dear old snowbile?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said a voice, and then
the lamps on the Bunnysnowbile grew so
bright that the old gentleman rabbit could
see who was sitting on the seat. And who
do you think it was?</p>

<p>You can have three guesses and another
one if you guess right. It was the Policeman
Dog. Yes, sir! There he sat as fine
as you please, with his club on his lap and
his big silver badge on his coat.</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you to bring back my
Bunnysnowbile,” said Uncle John Hare,
and then he pulled his head in and went
down stairs and showed the Policeman Dog
how to put the snow car into the stable without
waking up the Weathercock, who wasn’t
asleep, anyway, but just minded his own
business like a well-behaved iron rooster.</p>

<p>And then Lady Love opened the kitchen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
door and asked the Policeman Dog to come
in and have a hot cup of carrot tea, and
after a while he said good-by and went home
to his wife and seventeen children.</p>

<p>By and by the little rabbit said to his kind
Uncle: “Let’s go out on the Sunny Meadow
and dance in the moonlight.”</p>

<p>But the old gentleman rabbit said no.
He had a slight touch of rheumatism in his
left hind toe and wasn’t going to take any
chances. No, sireemam.</p>

<p>He wasn’t going to have plumbago,
ammonia or anything else just for the sake
of dancing, and I don’t blame him either.</p>

<p>So everybody went to bed, and when Mr.
Merry Sun woke up the next morning he
had a hard time waking up Mr. John Hare,
for the old gentleman rabbit was so sound
asleep that if Lady Love hadn’t rung the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
breakfast bell right over his head he might
have slept on until to-morrow’s story.</p>

<p>Well, after breakfast, as Little Jack Rabbit
looked over the paper, what do you suppose
he saw? Why, a notice that Mr.
Wicked Wolf had been found with his head
caught in an old hollow stump and that Old
Man Weasel had gone home to get his axe.</p>

<p>But when he had come back, Mr. Wicked
Wolf had already pulled the stump right
out of the ground and had gone home with
it on his head and it had taken his wife two
hours and eighty-five minutes to get it off.</p>

<p>“Gracious me!” exclaimed Lady Love.
“Did you ever hear of such a thing!” And
then she opened the kitchen door and peeked
out. But she closed it mighty quickly, for
she didn’t wish Uncle John Hare to catch
cold in his left hind toe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap large">Oh</span>, dear me, how Mr. North Wind did
blow! He rocked Mrs. Oriole’s nest that
hung from the willow tree by the Old Duck
Pond back and forth till Little Jack Rabbit
thought it would come off and drop to the
ground. But it didn’t, for Mrs. Oriole
knew how to knit, let me tell you, and her
stocking-like nest clung to the old willow
tree like a thrift stamp when you try to get
it off to buy something you forgot to get before
the war began!</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll let it alone,” said Mr.
North Wind; “maybe Mrs. Oriole will
want to use it next spring. Perhaps she
used up all her wool making sweaters for

darning-needles skimmed over the water.</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty soon, not so very long,” said
Mr. North Wind. “When Miss Spring
and her little Balmy Breezes come tripping
over the Sunny Meadow, I’ll say good-by!”
And then he whistled:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“I’m a husky old wind, I am,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I could blow the shell off a clam,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">I shake the shutters and bang the doors,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And curl the nails on the pussy cat’s paws.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then that boisterous old wind went
into the Shady Forest and broke a dead
limb off the old chestnut tree and nearly hit
Squirrel Nutcracker, who had come out of
his hole for a few minutes to stretch his legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Well, after that, the little rabbit hopped
along, clipperty-lipperty, and by and by he
saw Mr. Wicked Wolf. Oh, dear me.
Wasn’t that dreadful, for who wants to meet
a wolf even if his first name isn’t wicked?</p>

<p>“Hello, little bunny. I haven’t seen you
since the last time.”</p>

<p>“I wish you still had your head in the
Hollow Stump,” shivered Little Jack Rabbit,
and then he wiggled his little pink nose
so fast that Mr. Wicked Wolf had to shut
his eyes for fear he’d get dizzy.</p>

<p>“Stop that,” he shouted. “My head is
going around and around and I can’t keep
my feet in one place on the ground.”</p>

<p>“I can’t either,” said the little rabbit, “I’m
so frightened.” And before that dreadful
wolf opened his eyes, Little Jack Rabbit
hopped into an old hollow stump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Well, pretty soon, Mr. Wicked Wolf
opened one eye, just a little bit, you know,
and then he opened the other eye a little bit,
but he couldn’t see the little rabbit anywhere,
so he opened both his eyes, blink,
blink, just like that.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” he asked, and he
jumped over to the hollow stump, following
the little rabbit’s footprints in the snow,
you see. But when he looked down into
the hollow stump there wasn’t any little
white shivering bunny there. No, Sireemam
and No, Sireebus and No, Siree, Mr.
Prohibition Man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c17">MR. MINER MOLE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, I suppose you’ve been wondering
what had become of Little Jack Rabbit
after hopping into the old hollow stump to
get away from Mr. Wicked Wolf. Well,
you haven’t wondered nearly as much as
that old wicked wolf has, let me tell you.
Why, he was so puzzled that he sat down
and took an Almanac out of his pocket and
read it all through, but even then he didn’t
know anything.</p>

<p>“Goodness me, where has that little bunny
gone?” he said, and then he jumped right
into the old hollow stump, head first, kerplump,
just like that. Down, down he
went, until all of a sudden he landed somewhere
he didn’t just know where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>When, all of a sudden again, a voice said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“You robber bold, how can you dare</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To jump down here from way up there?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Wicked
Wolf, and he fixed his cravat, which was
all loose and not tied in a nice little knot,
“I’m sorry to trouble you. But the fact is
I was anxious about a little rabbit who
jumped in here a moment ago. Have you
seen him? I can’t see you, but maybe you
saw him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you see me pretty soon,” said the
voice, and then Mr. Wicked Wolf began to
get afraid. At first, you see, he wasn’t
scared a bit, but when he heard the voice
say that, he began to tremble and wabble,
and his long bushy tail to droop on the
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“Let me out; please do,” he said. “I’ll
never trouble you again.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, cross your heart and
repeat after me:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“I never break my promise,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">For fear I’ll break my heart,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">So I’ll give you my honest word,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And then we’ll kindly part,”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>said the voice, and when Mr. Wicked Wolf
had done that, the voice said:</p>

<p>“Now turn to your right and you’ll see a
little ladder.” And sure enough there was
a little ladder running right up the inside
of the old hollow stump. And goodness
me! As soon as Mr. Wicked Wolf saw the
ladder he went up it faster than a bricklayer
with a hod of bricks on his back, and
in less time than I can tell you, he was out
on the Sunny Meadow and off for his home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
in the Shady Forest, for he lived, you remember,
not so very far from the Big Brown
Bear’s cave.</p>

<p>And now I suppose you are still wondering
where little Jack Rabbit was, but I had
to get rid of that dreadful wolf first before
I could tell you. Well, as soon as Mr.
Wicked Wolf was out of the stump, which
was very dark inside, you know, somebody
turned on an electric light way down at the
bottom. And who do you suppose it was?
Why, Mr. Miner Mole. It was he who
had been talking to Mr. Wicked Wolf all
the time, and now on the next page you
shall hear about Little Jack Rabbit.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c18">PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, as soon as Mr. Miner Mole turned
on the electric light in his cap, he said:</p>

<p>“Little Jack Rabbit, you can come out
now, for Mr. Wicked Wolf has gone.”</p>

<p>At once the little bunny hopped out of a
door, and now you know where he had been
hiding. I declare, it has taken me almost
three stories to tell you, but I’ve been busy
explaining what Mr. Wolf did and after
that what Mr. Miner Mole said.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I would have done
if you hadn’t taken care of me,” said Little
Jack Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it,” said the kind
mole. “I’m glad you came down into my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
mine. I’ve had luck lately. I’ll give you
a couple of diamonds and three rubies.
You can make your kind Uncle John Hare
a present of one or three, if you wish.”</p>

<p>And then that generous mole gave these
beautiful precious stones to the little
bunny, and showed him how to climb the
ladder.</p>

<p>“I wish I had a little cap like yours with
an electric candle in it,” said the rabbit.
“I’d wear it at night and have lots of fun.”
But the mole wouldn’t give him his lamp.
I guess he thought more of it than he did
of his diamonds and rubies.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon, the little bunny said
good-by and climbed up the ladder, and
when he got to the top he just peeped over
the rim of the old hollow stump, for he
thought perhaps Mr. Wicked Wolf might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
be hanging around, but he wasn’t, so he
hopped away, clipperty-clipperty, and by
and by he thought of something.</p>

<p>“Gracious me! I almost forgot that I
had two diamonds and three rubies.” So
he opened his knapsack to make sure. And
now I suppose you are saying to yourself,
“That poor dear little rabbit has gone and
lost his precious stones!” But he hadn’t.
There they were as safe as safe could be in
his knapsack, right alongside of a piece of
apple pie and a lollypop!</p>

<p>“I might as well eat my lunch now,” he
thought, so he sat down, and pretty soon the
apple pie was gone and the lollypop, too.
And then, all of a sudden, a little bird began
to sing. It was Charlie Chickadee
but the little rabbit didn’t know it at
first:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“A nice little rabbit went down in a hole</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To see an old miner whose name was Mole,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then Charlie Chickadee flew down
to the ground and picked up some apple pie
crumbs which the little rabbit had dropped
when he bit off the next to the last piece of
crust.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you three guesses,” said the
little bunny. And in the next story you
shall hear whether Charlie Chickadee
guessed right the first or the third time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c19">THREE GUESSES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, let me see. Oh, yes, I remember now
where we left off. It was just when Little
Jack Rabbit gave Charlie Chickadee three
guesses. Yes, sir, that’s where we left off.
The little chickadee had only three guesses
to find out why Little Jack Rabbit had gone
down the Hollow Tree Stump Mine to see
the old miner, Mr. Mole.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” asked the little bunny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the little chickadee,
“you went to get some gold!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” answered the little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Then you went to get some silver.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” replied the little bunny.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” said Charlie Chickadee.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
“I’ve only one guess left, and I’m sure Mr.
Mole hasn’t got a coal mine,” and then the
little bird cocked his head on one side and
looked out of the corner of his left eye to
see if he had guessed it a little bit. But
Little Jack Rabbit didn’t pay any attention—he
just took out the two big diamonds
and the three immense big rubies and
looked at them carefully. At once Charlie
Chickadee hopped up and down, and fluttered
his wings, and shouted, “I know, I
know! Ha, ha ha, ha! you went to get diamonds
and rubies!”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Little Jack Rabbit,
and he strapped up his knapsack and started
off for Uncle John Hare’s house, for he
wanted to give his kind Uncle a ruby, you
know, and maybe a diamond.</p>

<p>“Goodness me, why did you go, then?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
asked Charlie Chickadee. “Everybody
around here knows how dangerous that
Hollow Tree Stump Mine is.”</p>

<p>“Because Mr. Wicked Wolf was so close
to me I had nowhere to go,” answered
Little Jack Rabbit, and then he told the
little bird all that had happened. “And
now I’m off to see Uncle John Hare.” And
the little bunny shouldered his knapsack.</p>

<p>Well, after a while he came to Carrot
Square in Turnip City, U. S. A., so he went
along for maybe three hundred and ninety-five
and a half hops till he came to Cabbage
Avenue, where on the corner stood a little
white house.</p>

<p>“Oh, here I am, how glad I am,” sang
the little rabbit, and just then Uncle John
himself opened the front door, and when he
saw his little nephew he began to sing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Wait till I show you what I’ve got for

knapsack.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you love your old Uncle,”
said Mr. John Hare, as he looked at the
precious stones. “To-day’s my birthday.
How did you remember?”</p>

<p>For answer the little bunny just hugged
his nice old uncle.</p>

</div>

<p>Then he closed his little Wisdom Book
and stroked his beak with his black wings.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy’s back from the army,”
said Lady Love proudly, and she took out
of her pocket a little flag and waved it up
and down. And then she took out of another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
pocket a little silver Liberty Bell and
rang it three times, and then she hopped
away to the postoffice, for she wanted to
send a letter to Aunt Columbia about her
little son’s discharge.</p>

<p>Well, when she reached the postoffice, the
postmistress, the old maid grasshopper I
told you about some million stories ago, who
had gone to Palm Beach for the winter,
looked out of her little stamp window and
said,</p>

<p>“Good morning, Lady Love. What can
I do for you? Now here’s a stamp already
damp, and it’s red, white and blue.”</p>

<p>“What a pretty little stamp,” said Lady
Love, as she put it on the envelope before
dropping her letter in the little crack in the
wall.</p>

<p>And then she went down to the Three-in-one-cent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
Store to buy a tea kettle. But just
as she started away for the Old Bramble
Patch, Mr. Wicked Wolf jumped out from
behind a tree. And, oh, dear me! If Lady
Love hadn’t opened her green silk parasol,
and held it in front of her, that wicked
old wolf would have eaten the carrot flowers
right off that little lady rabbit’s bonnet.</p>

<p>“Fold up your parasol,” said Mr. Wicked
Wolf, “or I’ll tear it into fourteen different
pieces.” And, of course, this frightened
Lady Love nearly to death, for she was
very fond of her green silk parasol, let me
tell you.</p>

<p>“If you do,” said she, “I’ll tell the Bunnyville
Regiment and they’ll hang you.” And
when Mr. Wicked Wolf heard that, he ran
away as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“Dearie me,” said poor frightened Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
Love, “times are dreadful.” And she hurried
home as fast as she could hop to put
the new tea kettle on to boil for supper.</p>

<p>And if the tea caddy doesn’t put golf balls

<p>“Never mind,” replied Little Jack Rabbit,

away he hopped, and by and by, pretty
soon, not so very long, he came to the Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>

Granddaddy Bullfrog sitting on his log,
winking and blinking in the sun.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Granddaddy Bullfrog,”
said Little Jack Rabbit, “have you had your
breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Had my breakfast?” almost shouted the
old gentleman frog. “Why, it’s almost time
for lunch. I guess you’ve forgotten to set
your watch ahead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” said the little rabbit, “I
have.” So he pulled out his gold watch
and chain, the one that dear Uncle John
Hare had given him, oh, ’umpty ’leven
stories ago, you remember, and then he set
it on an hour fast, and after that he looked
up at the sky and laughed.</p>

<p>“Now don’t get mad, Mr. Merry Sun!”</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t get mad,” said the jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
old fellow, “but I’ll tell you one thing, I
shan’t get up any earlier myself. You people
can do what you wish, but I’ve been on
time since the world began and I don’t propose
to be hurried at my age.” And then
he rolled behind a cloud just to show that
he meant what he said.</p>

<p>“Do you think he’s angry?” asked the
little rabbit.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” answered Granddaddy Bullfrog.
“What does he care if the factory
whistle blows an hour earlier. He doesn’t
have to hurry. He gets up in the purple
east every day at the same time.”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t,” said a voice, and there
stood Professor Jim Crow with his little
Wisdom Book.</p>

<p>“Let me read you something,” and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>

<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, let me see where we left off in the last
story. Oh, yes; now I remember. Professor
Jim Crow had just corrected Granddaddy
Bullfrog, who was dreadful angry
to think that he had made a mistake in saying
the sun got up every morning at the
same time. And, just as he was going to
say something more, a little tadpole swam
up to the log and called out:</p>

</div>

<p>Well, sir, Granddaddy Bullfrog gave one
look and then, kerplunk! he dived into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
water. And Professor Jim Crow flew
away, and so did Little Jack Rabbit—I
mean hopped, for rabbits don’t fly—and
pretty soon he got into a dreadful scrape.
Oh, dear me! I just hate to tell you about
it, but I must, for everything the little
bunny does I write down, even if I don’t see
him do it. And do you know how I learn
so much about him? I’ll tell you. It’s because
every morning Bobbie Redvest comes
to my window and says:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then I go to the window and ask him
in, and give him some cracker crumbs.
And as soon as he has had his breakfast he
tells me what to write about. And if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
didn’t there would be many days I wouldn’t
know what Little Jack Rabbit is doing, for
I can’t run after him in the Shady Forest
all the time.</p>

<p>And, now I’m going to tell you about the
scrape this dear little rabbit got into. Oh,
dear me again! I hope he’ll get out of it
all right! I told Bobbie Redvest to be
around to-morrow bright and early to let
me know.</p>

<p>Well, just as Little Jack Rabbit hopped
away from the Old Duck Pond he saw the
tip of Old Man Weasel’s nose from behind
a tree, and the tip of Danny Fox’s bushy
tail behind a rock, and the left ear of Mr.
Wicked Wolf from behind a bush. Wasn’t
that too dreadful for anything? Here were
these three enemies of the little rabbit just
waiting to catch him.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, oh, dear!” said the poor little
bunny, “I’m a goner now. I know, I know
it!” But he didn’t give up hope. Oh, my,
no! He just said that to himself, you see.
Not to anybody else. And just then he
heard Bobbie Redvest sing very softly:</p>

down a little stairway. But he didn’t forget
to bolt the door, and it’s mighty lucky
he did, for the next minute Old Man
Weasel, Mr. Wicked Wolf and Danny Fox
ran out from behind the trees and tried to
lift up the trap door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll dig a hole all around it,” said Danny
Fox, when they found they couldn’t get in.
So he set to work, and so did Old Man
Weasel, while Mr. Wicked Wolf sat down
and took out his pipe and smoked. And
whenever Danny Fox stopped to wipe the
perspiration from his face Mr. Wicked
Wolf would say, “Hurry up! The little
rabbit will be in China before you get
started!”</p>

<p>And whenever Old Man Weasel stopped
to wipe a little piece of dirt out of his eye,
Mr. Wicked Wolf would say:</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Old Man Weasel. Danny
Fox will get in first!”</p>

<p>Well, by and by, after a while, Danny
Fox came to the flight of stairs, and maybe
a minute or two later, Old Man Weasel got
his head inside the hallway, but there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
wasn’t room for both of them at the same
time.</p>

<p>“Get out of here,” said Danny Fox, “I
saw the little rabbit first.”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” shouted Old Man Weasel. “I
saw him before you did!” And then they
started to talk and talk, till at last Mr.
Wicked Wolf put his pipe back in his pocket
and said:</p>

<p>“You are both wrong. I saw him first.”
And he took hold of Danny Fox by the tail
and dragged him out, and Old Man Weasel,
too.</p>

<p>“You two talkers stay here while I go
after the little rabbit,” said Mr. Wicked
Wolf, and he ran down the stairs as fast as
he could. But, goodness me! it was dark.
And every once in a while he’d knock his
head against something, but he kept on just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the same, and pretty soon he saw a little
light ahead.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, a voice said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse indent0">“What are you doing down here under ground,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I don’t know who you are and I didn’t
know you were ill,” answered Mr. Wicked
Wolf, looking all around to see who was
talking. “Who are you, anyway?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c24">A PRISONER</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Well</span>, before Mr. Wicked Wolf found out
who was talking to him as I meant to tell
you in the last story, he saw the tip of
Little Jack Rabbit’s tail. So he didn’t stop
to find out, but ran down the dark tunnel
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” said the little rabbit to
himself, “I thought Mr. Mole would keep
him for a few minutes till I got away.”
And then the little rabbit hopped along
faster than ever, and I guess Mr. Wicked
Wolf would have caught him only the tunnel
was so low and so narrow that Mr.
Wicked Wolf had to be very careful not to
bump his head off.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon, the little rabbit came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
to a door, and when he opened it, he found
himself in the Shady Forest. And just then
who should come by but the Big Brown
Bear.</p>

<p>“Oh, help me, quick!” said Little Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“How?” asked the big bear.</p>

<p>“Roll that rock against this door,” begged
the little rabbit. “Mr. Wicked Wolf is
after me.”</p>

<p>Then the Big Brown Bear put his
shoulder against the rock and rolled it up
against the door, and then he sat down and
said: “Whew! That was a job!” And I
guess it was, for he was all out of breath, for
the rock was as large as himself and maybe
bigger.</p>

<p>“Let me out! Let me out!” shouted Mr.
Wicked Wolf through the keyhole, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
couldn’t even open the door a tiny crack
because the bear had rolled the stone up
against it as tight as could be.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“You stay in there till the 4th of July,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>shouted the Big Brown Bear as he and the
little rabbit hopped away. Dear me!
Maybe the bear didn’t hop, but I was so excited
for fear Little Jack Rabbit wouldn’t
get away that my typewriter picked out the
wrong word.</p>

<p>“Gracious me!” said the little rabbit,
after a while, and maybe a mile. “I guess
I’ll telephone to Uncle John Hare and tell
him what a narrow escape I’ve just had!”
So he hopped in the Hollow Tree Telephone
booth and called up “One, two, three,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Ring Happy Bell, Rabbitville, U. S. A.”
And pretty soon he heard Uncle John Hare
say, “Hello, who is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s me, Little Jack Rabbit,” answered
the little bunny. And then he told the dear
old gentleman rabbit what had happened
and Uncle John Hare got so excited that
he dropped the receiver on his left hind toe—the
one that had the rheumatism in it,
you remember—and this made him say
something which I won’t repeat.</p>

<p>“Come over right away,” he said, after
rubbing his toe three times and a half.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps I’ve made a mistake, or Professor

<p>“Haven’t you made a mistake?” asked
Little Jack Rabbit as the old crow started
to read a lesson on fishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” he answered. “Maybe
I’m getting old. I’ve turned to the wrong
place.” And then he opened the book at
page 23 and read:</p>

<div class="verse indent0">“Dingle, dingle, trolley car,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed Little Jack Rabbit.
“The Rabbitville trolley cars have lady
bunny conductors,” and off he hopped to
take a ride, for he had five carrot cents in
his knapsack.</p>

<p>Well, just as he reached Rabbitville a
trolley car came by, so he held up his
striped candy cane and the motorman put
on the brakes, and then the little rabbit
hopped on board and the lady bunny conductor
rang the bell three times and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
and away they went to Bunnybridge, just
over Clover River.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said a voice as the little rabbit
sat down, and there in the middle of the
car sat Squirrel Nutcracker. He was reading
the Chestnut Times and laughing over
Miss Hazel Nut’s jokes.</p>

<p>“Come over and sit by me,” said Old
Squire Nutcracker. “Here’s something
about your Uncle.” And then he started
to read:</p>

<p>“Mr. John Hare has just repainted his
house on the corner of Carrot Avenue and
Cabbage Square. He says he must have his
house nice and white so he can see it late
at night.”</p>

<p>And then Squirrel Nutcracker laughed
some more, and he laughed so hard that a
hickory nut rolled out of his coat pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
and fell on the lady conductor’s little toe
and made her dreadfully angry, for she
thought Little Jack Rabbit had shot the nut
out of his little popgun, you know.</p>

<p>And just then the trolley bell began to
ring like everything. Maybe there was
some one on the track.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">Now</span>, let me see where we left off in the last
story. Oh, yes, I remember now. It was
just as the trolley car bell rang on the way
to Bunnybridge.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Squirrel Nutcracker,
for the car stopped so suddenly that
his hat came off. And then they heard the
motorman, who was a billy goat, say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Why don’t you get out of the way</div>
<div class="verse indent0">With your cracky old wagon of hay,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">When you’re on the track,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And not keep me waiting all day.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And who do you suppose was driving the
load of hay? Why, it was Old Farmer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
Daddy Longlegs. He was sitting on top
and saying giddap to a pair of little field
mice.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Mr. Motorman,” answered
Farmer Daddy Longlegs. “Just
wait a minute and I’ll get off the track.”</p>

<p>And then he turned the little mice to the
right, and when the trolley car went by it
pulled off some of the hay and it fell into
the open window and covered Mrs. Duck’s
new bonnet, with the yellow roses on it.</p>

<p>“I’ll make a wish, for every time you pass
a load of hay you must make a wish, you
know, and if you don’t tell anybody it will
surely come true,” she said with a quack.</p>

<p>Well, by and by, after a while, they came
to Clover River, and as the trolley car
couldn’t swim it went over the bridge, and
in less than five hundred short seconds it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
stopped in Bunnybridge, on the corner of
Cookey Street and Cocoanut Avenue.</p>

<p>“Last stop. All out,” shouted the billy
goat conductor, so all the passengers left
by the front door, for there was a big sign
in the car which said:</p>

<div class="verse indent0">“Have your nickel ready</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, oh, dear me. Just as Little Jack

</div>

<p>Well, the little rabbit began to count just
as fast as he could, and just as he reached
nine thousand nine hundred and maybe a
little more the Yellow Dog Tramp came by
and gave a loud bark:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" id="p1">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Don’t hurt my bunny friend;</div>

<div class="verse indent0">A million miles away.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when Mr. Wicked Wolf heard that
he turned around and ran home as fast as
he could, and maybe faster.</p>

<p>“Come with me, little rabbit,” said the
kind Yellow Dog Tramp. So they went
into the wood and turned down a little path
until they came to a tiny house under a big
oak tree. And right over the front door
was a sign:</p>

<p>“Acorn Cottage.”</p>

<p>“Who lives there?” asked Little Jack
Rabbit.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” said the Yellow Dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Tramp, and then he knocked three times
and pretty soon a little Green Snake opened
the door. She had on a little pink bonnet
and a white apron and on the end of her
tail was a pretty gold watch.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she asked, for she
was a very timid little snake, let me tell you,
and was dreadfully afraid of tramps and
burglars.</p>

<p>“My little rabbit friend would like to
find his fortune,” said the Yellow Dog
Tramp, “and I hear you are very wise
and know how to tell fortunes better than
a gypsy. So please tell my little bunny
friend where his fortune is.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said the little Green Snake.
So Little Jack Rabbit and the Yellow Dog
Tramp went into the little house, and pretty
soon she told Little Jack Rabbit to sit down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“You have two Liberty Bonds and three
War Saving Stamps,” she said, after she
had looked at the lines in his little paw,
“and in three days and a half you will find
a bright penny under a stone on the Shady
Forest Trail. That will be the beginning
of your fortune.” And then she coiled herself
up and began to sway back and forth,
and in the next story you shall hear what
happened after that.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap large">You</span> remember in the last story as the little
Green Snake coiled herself in a ring and
swayed back and forth, she began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Under a stone on the Forest Trail</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I will,” said Little Jack Rabbit, and
then he and Yellow Dog Tramp set out,
and by and by they saw a little stone just
ahead of them. And close beside it was a
black snail in her little house which she always
carries around with her, rain or shine.</p>

<p>“Hurrah,” cried the little rabbit, “now I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
will find my fortune,” and he pushed aside
the stone and was just going to pick up the
bright penny when a voice said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Don’t you touch that penny,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">For it belongs to Jenny,</div>
<div class="verse indent0">To pretty little Jenny Wren</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Who lives down in the shady glen.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” sighed Little Jack Rabbit,
“I thought I could take it.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked the Yellow Dog
Tramp, looking all around to see who had
spoken, but there was no one in sight. And
just then, all of a sudden, out jumped
Chippy Chipmunk in his little striped
jacket. “That penny belongs to Jenny
Wren. She lost it this morning.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you take it to her?” said
the Yellow Dog Tramp.</p>

<p>“I’m keeping watch till she comes back,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
answered Chippy Chipmunk. “I don’t
know where she went.” And then the little
chipmunk laughed and picked up a nut and
stuffed it into the little pocket in his left
cheek.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no use waiting here,” said
Little Jack Rabbit. “I must get back to
the Old Bramble Patch before sundown or
mother will worry.” And off he started,
lipperty lip, clipperty clip, but just then
who should come by but little Jenny Wren
herself. She wasn’t flying. Oh, my, no.
She was walking slowly over the ground
and looked here and there and everywhere.</p>

<p>“Did you see a bright penny?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It’s by that stone,” said Little Jack Rabbit.
“Close by the snail in her little shell
house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>So Jenny Wren hopped over to the stone
and picked up her lost penny, and if she

good friend run away.</p>

<p>Well, after that, the little bunny hopped
along, and by and by he saw Timmy Meadowmouse
near his little house in the Sunny
Meadow. And if you’ve forgotten what
Timmy Meadowmouse’s house looks like
I’ll tell you. It’s like a little ball, made
out of grass, woven together on the top of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
two or three stiff stalks of meadow grass.</p>

<p>“Hello, Timmy Meadowmouse. What
are you doing?”</p>

<p>“Keeping a lookout for Hungry Hawk,”
he answered. “It was only a few minutes
ago he flew by, way up in the sky. Oh,
ever so high. But I don’t want to be
caught in his cruel claws,” and the little
meadowmouse shivered at the thought.</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” said Little Jack Rabbit.
“I won’t wait, but hurry home to the Old
Bramble Patch.” And it was a good thing
he did, for just then Hungry Hawk came
sailing by and if he had seen the little rabbit
maybe he would have stooped down and
caught him then and there and maybe some
other place.</p>

<p>“What has kept you so late?” asked Lady
Love as her little bunny son hopped up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
the garden walk to the kitchen door, where
the good lady bunny stood shading her eyes
with her left hind paw. She said nothing
when she learned how he had almost been
caught by Mr. Wicked Wolf and that the
Yellow Dog Tramp had come by just in
time. But when he said he had found a
penny, she exclaimed: “Where is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” answered the little rabbit, “it
belonged to Jenny Wren. She lost it this
morning, so I had to give it to her.”</p>

<p>And just then the telephone rang.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Little Jack Rabbit. “Is it
you?”</p>

<p>“It surely is,” said the old gentleman rabbit.
“What do you suppose is the matter?”
But Little Jack Rabbit couldn’t guess, and
I don’t believe you can, so I’ll tell you right
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>“My Sonora won’t stop singing,” said the
old gentleman rabbit, “and the three grasshoppers
and the black cricket on the hearth
can’t sleep. So what shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Call in the Old Red Rooster. He used
to work in a talking machine factory before
he came to you.”</p>

<p>And that’s just what Uncle John Hare
did, and the next day he came over in his
Bunnymobile and took Little Jack Rabbit
out for a long drive.</p>

<p>“Please don’t,” begged the Old Red
Rooster. “She’s a very old hen and it might
worry her so she couldn’t lay an egg.”</p>

<p>Just then Little Jack Rabbit and Uncle
John Hare drove up in the Bunnymobile, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
the little black spider began to spin a new
web and the Old Red Rooster commenced
to dust off the top of the buggy.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, home again,” said
the old gentleman rabbit, and he took off
his old wedding stovepipe hat and wiped
his forehead with his blue silk polkadot
handkerchief, and after that he looked at his
gold watch and chain and fixed the diamond
horseshoe pin in his red necktie.
You see, there was a little old broken mirror
which he kept in the barn so that in case
his stovepipe hat wasn’t on straight he
could fix it before going out automobiling.</p>

<p>As soon as the Bunnymobile was safe in
the garage he and Little Jack Rabbit went
into the house and wound up the graphophone.
And this is the song it sang:</p>

<p>Dear, dear me! Here we are at the end

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
